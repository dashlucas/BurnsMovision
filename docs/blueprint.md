- Split-Screen Layout: Maintain a consistent 50/50 split-screen layout on both desktop and mobile devices using Tailwind CSS.

- Primary color: Green (#62A8AB), providing an action color to the menu, drawing inspiration from concepts of healing and tranquility in physiotherapy. It conveys trust, growth, and stability.
- Background (Left Panel): White (#F8FAFC) to ensure readability for the logo and subtitle.
- Background (Right Panel): Purple (#49416D) to give the buttons emphasis on contrast.
- Font: 'Raleway' sans-serif for all text elements (logo, subtitle, buttons).
- Maintain a 50/50 split screen on desktop and mobile.
- Center content vertically and horizontally within each panel.
- Font weights: Use 800 for 'Iniciar' button text and 700 for 'Tutorial' and 'Recomendações' button text.
